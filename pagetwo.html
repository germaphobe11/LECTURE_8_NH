        Relaxation is a state of being free from tension or stress, both
        physically and mentally. It involves slowing down one's breathing and
        heart rate, releasing muscular tension, and quieting the mind.
        Relaxation techniques can include deep breathing exercises, meditation,
        yoga, tai chi, or any other activity that helps calm the body and mind.
        Relaxation is essential for maintaining good mental and physical health,
        as it reduces the negative effects of stress and promotes a sense of
        well-being and balance in one's life.
